# hello-world

Eyes up, Guardian. I'm Andrei! I'm a 23 year old aspiring programmer/developer (unsure of which term to use) who is putting as much time and effort as I can into learning programming languages. My goal is to learn as many of the most relevant and upcoming languages as I possibly can, back and front end alike. Starting out, I'm mainly focusing on Java until I have a real solid understand of it but am eager to expand my knowledge and skillbase.
I may be new to all of this but I have been quickly grasping concepts and ideas, the hard part is memorizing them so as to not have to constantly look up documentation.

Tacos are the best.
